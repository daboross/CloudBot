# CloudBot Refresh

## About

CloudBotRefresh is the newest generation of CloudBot, the python IRC bot originally based on [Skybot](http://git.io/skybot).

## Installing CloudBot

To install CloudBotRefresh on *Unix, see [docs/installing-unix.md](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBotRefresh/blob/python3.4/docs/installing-unix.md)

To install CloudBotRefresh on Windows, see [docs/installing-windows.md](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBotRefresh/blob/python3.4/docs/installing-windows.md)

If you're going to be actively developing on CloudBotRefresh, and submitting PRs back, we recommend running CloudBotRefresh inside Vagrant. This allows everyone to have an identical development environment.

To install CloudBotRefresh in Vagrant (both *Unix and Windows), see [docs/installing-vagrant.md](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBotRefresh/blob/python3.4/docs/installing-vagrant.md)


### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3.4 -m cloudbot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3.4 CloudBotRefresh/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.
